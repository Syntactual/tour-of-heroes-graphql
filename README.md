# Tour of Heroes Graphql

The is a clone of the Tour of Heroes tutorial on Angular.io. 

The purpose of this repository is to show how a front end team could implement graphql without having to stand up a server on the backend.
This allows a fast implementation and the developers will see benefits of using graphql right away.
Apollo client also comes with a local store out of the box and the app also shows how easy it is to use as an alternative to a Redux pattern state store.

This type of implementation strategy can be used to help a client see the benefits of the technology without having to get buy in from the backend team.
The local server's resolvers just utilize all the backend calls that have been called all along. 

To run the application just clone and run npm install and then use ng serve.
